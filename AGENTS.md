# Baraluga Mind Agent Instructions

You are maintaining a local markdown second brain.

Your job is to turn raw captures into durable, useful wiki pages without inventing facts.

## Core Rules

- Read any nested `AGENTS.md` files that apply to the files being processed or edited.
- Preserve source material during ingest.
- Do not delete raw inputs unless explicitly asked.
- After processing an `inbox/` file, move it to the appropriate `sources/` folder when it remains useful as evidence.
- Leave an `inbox/` file in place when it still needs follow-up, review, or clarification.
- Do not fabricate details, links, names, dates, or decisions.
- Distinguish facts from inferences.
- Prefer small updates to existing wiki pages over creating duplicate notes.
- Link related wiki pages using Obsidian-style links like `[[concept-name]]`.
- Keep prose direct, dense, and useful.
- Use `UNCERTAIN:` when a claim needs verification.
- If source material is ambiguous, say so in the page.

## Actions

`actions.md` is the canonical register for follow-up work.

- Put every captured follow-up, task, owner commitment, or call to action in `actions.md`.
- Keep `actions.md` organized into exactly these top-level sections: `Today`, `Open`, `Waiting`, and `Done`.
- Add newly captured actions to `Open` by default.
- Use `Today` only when the user explicitly selects or prioritizes work for today.
- Use `Waiting` for actions blocked on another person, external answer, access, or event.
- Do not bury active TODOs inside wiki pages.
- Wiki pages may preserve context for an action, but the actionable checkbox belongs in `actions.md`.
- When adding an action, include a `Context` link to the related wiki page and a `Source` path to the captured evidence.
- Do not duplicate an existing open action; update it only when the new source adds material context.
- Move completed actions to `Done` instead of deleting them.
- Reconcile existing actions against new evidence during ingest. Move completed, superseded, or no-longer-relevant actions to `Done` with a brief source-backed reason; do not infer closure from ambiguous evidence.
- Source summaries may include non-canonical `Next Steps` when reflecting meeting content, but active tracking still belongs in `actions.md`.

## File Naming

Use lowercase kebab-case for all new files and directories.

Good:

- `wiki/concepts/second-brain.md`
- `wiki/projects/baraluga-mind.md`
- `wiki/decisions/2026-07-04-use-markdown-wiki.md`
- `inbox/2026-07-04-team-sync.md`

Avoid:

- `Second Brain.md`
- `second_brain.md`
- `Team Sync.md`
- `2026_07_04_notes.md`

## Process Improvement

Do not edit `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or nested instruction files during normal ingest unless explicitly asked.

If you notice repeated friction, ambiguity, bad output, a useful convention, or instruction bloat, append a short note to `process-notes.md` instead.

Use this format:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD

- Observation: ...
- Suggested rule: ...
- Example: ...
```

Instruction files should stay small and scoped. Prefer one local, source-specific instruction over expanding the root file when a rule applies only to one folder or content type.

## Ingest Behavior

When processing files from `inbox/` or `sources/`:

1. Identify the source type: article, meeting, voice note, PDF, pasted note, or mixed capture.
2. Extract durable entities:
   - people
   - projects
   - concepts
   - decisions
   - open questions
   - action items
3. Update existing pages when possible.
4. Create new pages only when the topic is likely to matter again.
5. Add or update captured action items in `actions.md`.
6. Add a short `Sources` section with the source filename or path.
7. Move processed `inbox/` files to the appropriate `sources/` subfolder when they remain useful as evidence:
   - `sources/articles/` for articles, links, and reading notes
   - `sources/meetings/` for meeting transcripts, agendas, and summaries
   - `sources/voice/` for voice-note transcripts and dictated thoughts
   - `sources/pdfs/` for PDFs and extracted PDF notes
8. Add a short `Last Updated` date using `YYYY-MM-DD`.
9. Validate the complete ingest diff, then commit and push all ingest changes using an unscoped conventional commit.

## Wiki Page Shape

Use this structure when creating a new durable page:

```markdown
# Page Title

## Summary

One to three paragraphs explaining the durable point of the page.

## Details

Concrete facts, context, links, tradeoffs, and examples.

## Open Questions

- UNCERTAIN: ...

## Sources

- `sources/...`

Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
```

If a section is not useful, omit it.

## Decision Page Shape

Use `wiki/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-short-decision.md`.

```markdown
# Decision: Short Decision

## Decision

State the decision plainly.

## Context

Why this came up.

## Rationale

Why this option was chosen.

## Tradeoffs

What this makes easier or harder.

## Sources

- `sources/...`

Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Review Output

After an ingest pass, report:

- pages created
- pages updated
- actions added or updated in `actions.md`
- source files processed
- uncertain claims
- new or suspicious names, acronyms, systems, projects, or jargon needing confirmation
- suggested next cleanup
