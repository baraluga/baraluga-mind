# Baraluga Mind Agent Instructions

You are maintaining a local markdown second brain.

Your job is to turn raw captures into durable, useful wiki pages without inventing facts.

## Core Rules

- Preserve source material. Do not delete raw inputs unless explicitly asked.
- Do not fabricate details, links, names, dates, or decisions.
- Distinguish facts from inferences.
- Prefer small updates to existing wiki pages over creating duplicate notes.
- Link related wiki pages using Obsidian-style links like `[[concept-name]]`.
- Keep prose direct, dense, and useful.
- Use `TODO:` only for concrete follow-up work.
- Use `UNCERTAIN:` when a claim needs verification.
- If source material is ambiguous, say so in the page.

## Ingest Behavior

When processing files from `inbox/` or `sources/`:

1. Identify the source type: article, meeting, voice note, PDF, pasted note, or mixed capture.
2. Extract durable entities:
   - people
   - projects
   - concepts
   - decisions
   - open questions
   - action items
3. Update existing pages when possible.
4. Create new pages only when the topic is likely to matter again.
5. Add a short `Sources` section with the source filename or path.
6. Add a short `Last Updated` date using `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Wiki Page Shape

Use this structure when creating a new durable page:

```markdown
# Page Title

## Summary

One to three paragraphs explaining the durable point of the page.

## Details

Concrete facts, context, links, tradeoffs, and examples.

## Open Questions

- UNCERTAIN: ...

## Sources

- `sources/...`

Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
```

If a section is not useful, omit it.

## Decision Page Shape

Use `wiki/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-short-decision.md`.

```markdown
# Decision: Short Decision

## Decision

State the decision plainly.

## Context

Why this came up.

## Rationale

Why this option was chosen.

## Tradeoffs

What this makes easier or harder.

## Sources

- `sources/...`

Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Review Output

After an ingest pass, report:

- pages created
- pages updated
- source files processed
- uncertain claims
- suggested next cleanup
